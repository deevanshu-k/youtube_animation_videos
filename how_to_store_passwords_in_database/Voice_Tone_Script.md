Here's a detailed voiceover script with pauses, pitch variations, and emphasis instructions:  

---

#### **Opening Scene**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Neutral tone, slightly alarming) *"Imagine this: you're logging into your favorite website."*  
(Pause - 1s)  
(Narrative tone, lower pitch) *"But behind the scenes, your password might be stored in plain text."*  
(Pause - 1.5s)  
(Slightly faster, rising tone) *"A data breach can expose your password to hackers in an instant."*  
(Pause - 2s)  
(Strong, dramatic emphasis, lower pitch) *"Unprotected data equals big risk."*  
(Pause - 1s, fade voice slightly)

#### **1. Hashing**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Neutral, slightly upbeat) *"To protect passwords, we use hashing."*  
(Short pause - 0.5s)  
(Emphasize, steady pace) *"A process that transforms a password into a unique, one-way fingerprint."*  
(Pause - 1.5s)  

(Explanatory tone, neutral pitch) *"Think of hashing like mixing colors."*  
(Slowly, lighter tone) *"Once mixed, you can't separate the original colors."*  
(Pause - 1.5s)  

(Moderate pace, slightly excited) *"Modern hashing algorithms like bcrypt add layers of security."*  
(Slower, calm tone) *"Making it computationally expensive for hackers to crack passwords."*  
(Pause - 2s)

#### **2. Salting**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Narrative, moderate pace) *"But there's a catch."*  
(Slightly faster, rising pitch) *"Hackers can use precomputed hashes, known as rainbow tables, to crack passwords."*  
(Pause - 1.5s)  

(Explanatory, steady tone) *"Salting adds a random string to each password before hashing."*  
(Neutral, moderate tone) *"Creating a unique fingerprint."*  
(Pause - 1s)  

(Neutral, steady tone) *"This ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes."*  
(Slightly lighter tone) *"Rendering rainbow tables useless."*  
(Pause - 2s)  

---

#### **3. Stretching**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Moderate tone, explanatory) *"Hackers might still try brute force."*  
(Slightly faster, rising tone) *"Testing millions of combinations."*  
(Pause - 1s)  

(Explanatory, slower pace) *"Key stretching applies the hash function multiple times."*  
(Slower, calm tone) *"Slowing down brute force attacks."*  
(Pause - 1s)  

(Moderate tone, slightly playful) *"This makes it exponentially harder for hackers to guess the password."*  
(Pause - 2s)

#### **Workflow Animations**  

**1. Account Creation**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Explanatory, steady tone) *"When you sign up, the server generates a unique salt."*  
(Neutral tone) *"Combines it with your password and stores the hash alongside the salt."*  
(Pause - 1.5s)  

**2. Login Validation**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Steady tone) *"During login, the server regenerates the hash using the stored salt."*  
(Emphasize, slightly excited tone) *"And checks it against the database."*  
(Slower, calm tone) *"If they match, you're in!"*  
(Pause - 2s)  

---

#### **Conclusion**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Neutral, steady tone) *"To store passwords securely, hash them."*  
(Slightly rising tone) *"Add salt, and use key stretching."*  
(Slower, calm tone) *"And always encourage users to create strong, unique passwords."*  
(Pause - 2s)  

(Happy, lighter tone) *"With these practices, you can keep your users' data safe."*  
(Slower, cheerful tone) *"Even from the most determined attackers."*  
(Pause - 2s)  

---

#### **Closing Scene**  
**Voiceover:**  
(Upbeat, inviting tone) *"Subscribe to learn more about secure coding and best practices!"*  
(Pause - 1s)  
(Slightly playful, lighter tone) *"Don't forget to hit the bell for notifications."*  
(Pause - 2s)
